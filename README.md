A fun and interactive number guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game generates a random secret number within a defined range (default: 1-100)
2. You make a guess by entering a number
3. The game provides feedback:
   - **Too High!** - Your guess is higher than the secret number
   - **Too Low!** - Your guess is lower than the secret number
   - **Correct!** - You've guessed the number!
4. Try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible
